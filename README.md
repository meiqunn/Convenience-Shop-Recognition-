# Convenience Shop Recognition 

Skill Set:KNN , MLP Classifier, Euclidean Distance, Perceptron and Support Vector Classifier.

Objective: This project is to develop a Convenience Shop Recognition system by training and optimizing several machine learning algorithms. The goal is to create a model that can accurately recognize and classify convenience shop labels based on various features such as logos, color schemes, or text patterns. By utilizing these algorithms, the system will learn to identify distinctive patterns and characteristics of shop labels from a dataset of labeled images or data, enabling it to predict the correct label efficiently. The focus is on improving the model's performance through fine-tuning and selection of appropriate algorithms to achieve high prediction accuracy. 
Output:The system will consistently and accurately identify the correct store label in a variety of situations, ensuring minimal error and high confidence in the prediction.
